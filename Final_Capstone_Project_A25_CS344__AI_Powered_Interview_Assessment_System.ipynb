The first one is actually to meet the specific accuracy or validation loss for the evaluation matrix. And yeah, actually, that's just need to take some trial and error with different architecture. For example, like we can try to add more layer, more neurons, changes the neurons. Or even I also apply the dropout layer. So yeah, it really helps with the validation loss to become more lower, right? And yeah, I think that's one of the biggest challenges that I have while working on this certification.\n",

Especially for some cases that we need to use deep learning using Keras applications, for example, like image classification, we can use transfer learning models, which is, that's already a trained model with exceptionally high accuracy, high performance. Yeah, even though it's trained with different data sets, but it really helps to improve our model performance, model accuracy, model loss. For example, like MobileNet, VGC19, VGC16, EfficientNet, it will help to improve our models, comparing to the one if you use a traditional CNN model. So, yeah, CNN model with the convolutional 2D, yeah, max pooling, and yeah, it's quite good, actually, to use transfer learning.

This is also I used the research project for my undergraduate thesis, for my scripts. I used this model. It's quite challenging. Even though it's achieved high accuracy with some dense layer, with some drawout layer. And trial and error also with the callback function with the neurons. But the problem is the dataset is not balanced. So it has the imbalanced class dataset. The approach that I used is just to use the technique called smooth and synthetic oversampling technique with edited nearest neighbor.

Ah, okay. About transfer learning is actually, we use existing trained model from TensorFlow, for example, like VGC16, VGC19, right? Especially for some cases that we need to use deep learning using Keras applications, for example, like image classification, we can use transfer learning models, which is, that's already a trained model with exceptionally high accuracy, high performance. Yeah, even though it's trained with different data sets, but it really helps to improve our model performance, model accuracy, model loss. For example, like MobileNet, VGC19, VGC16, EfficientNet, it will help to improve our models, comparing to the one if you use a traditional CNN model. So, yeah, CNN model with the convolutional 2D, yeah, max pooling, and yeah, it's quite good, actually, to use transfer learning. It really helps with our model performance, to improve our model performance.\",\n          \" Describe the process of building a new section, okay. The CNN one, right? So, at the first time, of course, we need to make sure the image folder is split for each class, okay? And then we can use Keras preprocessing, if I'm not mistaken, image dataset from directory to split the training and the validation dataset, right? Yeah, of course, we can use another set, which is the test dataset, yeah. But, yeah, okay, the next one, we can just, maybe we need to implement also the image augmentation, yeah, data image augmentation to make our dataset more veritative, right? For example, like, we can rotate, we can zoom it, we can crop it, yeah. And, yeah, the last thing, yeah, of course, we can build our chain model with the Convolutional 2D, specify the filters, the kernel size, the LRM definition, of course, the input shape for the first layer, and then we can apply the Max Pooling 2D, yeah, and the next layer, we can just use Convolutional 2D, Max Pooling, and whatever it is. And after that, we apply the flatten layer and dropout layer, if you want. And the last thing, don't forget to use the dash layer, right, for the output, the last output layer.\",\n          \" Describe a core model you've built and the steps you took to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Complex transfer model you've built to ensure accuracy. Okay, I will take one of my previous projects that I used. I also used Keras transfer model. It is about celiac disease prediction. This is also I used the research project for my undergraduate thesis, for my scripts. I used this model. It's quite challenging. Even though it's achieved high accuracy with some dense layer, with some drawout layer. And trial and error also with the callback function with the neurons. But the problem is the dataset is not balanced. So it has the imbalanced class dataset. The approach that I used is just to use the technique called smooth and synthetic oversampling technique with edited nearest neighbor.

How do you benefit from the projects? ah, ok, uh About transfer learning is actually uh we use existing train model from tensorflow for example uh like VGG16, VGG19 right uh especially uh for for some cases uh that we need to use deep learning using Keras applications uh for example like image classification, we can use transfer learning uh models which is that's already uh trained model with uh exceptionally uh high accuracy high performance uh yeah even though it's trained with different uh datasets but it it really helps uh to improve uh our uh model performance uh, model accuracy, model loss uh and yeah uh for example like mobile net, VGG19, VGG16 ya, efficient net uh. It will help to improve our our models uh comparing to the one if you use a traditional uh CNN model yeah CNN model uh with the convolutional uh 2d yeah max pooling and yeah it's it's quite good actually to use uh transfer learning it really helps uh with our model performance to improve our model performance.\",\n          \" describe the process of building image, okay uh the cnn one, right so, uh at the first time uh of course uh, we need to make sure uh there are split uh the the image folder split for for uh each uh class okay, uh and then we can use uh Keras preprocessing if I'm not mistaken uh image dataset from directory to split the training and the validation uh dataset right, uh yeah of course we can use another another set which is the test dataset, yeah uh but yeah, okay the next one uh we can, uh yeah we can just uh maybe we we need to implement also the image augmentation yeah, data uh data image data augmentation to uh to make our dataset more uh variative, right for example like we can rotate we can zoom it, we can uh crop it yeah, uh and yeah the last thing, yeah of course we we can build our gen model with the convolutional 2d uh specify the filters, the kernel size, the LRF division of course the input the input shape for the first layer and then we can apply the max pooling 2d uh yeah, and the next layer we can just use convolutional 2D, max pooling and uh whatever it is uh and after that uh we apply the flatten layer uh and dropout layer if you want and the last thing uh don't forget to use the dense layer, right for the output, like uh the last.\",\n          \" Describe a complex tensorflow model you've built and the steps you took to ensure its accuracy and efficiency hm, uh complex tensorflow model you've built and steps you took to ensure its accuracy hm, ok, uh i will take one of my uh previous project that uh i use, yeah i also use keras tensorflow model uh its it is uh about uh celiac disease prediction ya uh yeah, this is also i use uh the research project for my uh undergraduate thesis yeah for my skripsi and uh i use this model, it's quite challenging uh even though it's uh achieved high accuracy yeah with with some dense layer yeah, with some uh dropout layer and trial and error with the uh also with the uh callback function yeah uh with the neurons but the problem is the dataset is not uh balance yeah so it has the imbalanced uh class datasets yeah and uh the the approach that i use is to yeah just to use uh the technique called smote and yeah synthetic oversampling technique with edited nearest neighbor. yeah which is, uh Basically it's just oversampling and undersampling uh the datasets. uh It helps with the accuracy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Ah, okay. About transfer learning is actually, we use existing trained model from TensorFlow, for example, like VGC16, VGC19, right? Especially for some cases that we need to use deep learning using Keras applications, for example, like image classification, we can use transfer learning models, which is, that's already a trained model with exceptionally high accuracy, high performance. Yeah, even though it's trained with different data sets, but it really helps to improve our model performance, model accuracy, model loss. For example, like MobileNet, VGC19, VGC16, EfficientNet, it will help to improve our models, comparing to the one if you use a traditional CNN model. So, yeah, CNN model with the convolutional 2D, yeah, max pooling, and yeah, it's quite good, actually, to use transfer learning. It really helps with our model performance, to improve our model performance.\",\n          \" Describe the process of building a new section, okay. The CNN one, right? So, at the first time, of course, we need to make sure the image folder is split for each class, okay? And then we can use Keras preprocessing, if I'm not mistaken, image dataset from directory to split the training and the validation dataset, right? Yeah, of course, we can use another set, which is the test dataset, yeah. But, yeah, okay, the next one, we can just, maybe we need to implement also the image augmentation, yeah, data image augmentation to make our dataset more veritative, right? For example, like, we can rotate, we can zoom it, we can crop it, yeah. And, yeah, the last thing, yeah, of course, we can build our chain model with the Convolutional 2D, specify the filters, the kernel size, the LRM definition, of course, the input shape for the first layer, and then we can apply the Max Pooling 2D, yeah, and the next layer, we can just use Convolutional 2D, Max Pooling, and whatever it is. And after that, we apply the flatten layer and dropout layer, if you want. And the last thing, don't forget to use the dash layer, right, for the output, the last output layer.\",\n          \" Describe a core model you've built and the steps you took to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Complex transfer model you've built to ensure accuracy. Okay, I will take one of my previous projects that I used. I also used Keras transfer model. It is about celiac disease prediction. This is also I used the research project for my undergraduate thesis, for my scripts. I used this model. It's quite challenging. Even though it's achieved high accuracy with some dense layer, with some drawout layer. And trial and error also with the callback function with the neurons. But the problem is the dataset is not balanced. So it has the imbalanced class dataset. The approach that I used is just to use the technique called smooth and synthetic oversampling technique with edited nearest neighbor. Which is basically just oversampling and undersampling the dataset. It helps with the accuracy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stt_confidence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.9267146270562436,\n        \"min\": 90.15,\n        \"max\": 92.71,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          92.71,\n          91.75,\n          91.45\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Ah, okay. About transfer learning is actually, we use existing trained model from TensorFlow, for example, like VGC16, VGC19, right? Especially for some cases that we need to use deep learning using Keras applications, for example, like image classification, we can use transfer learning models, which is, that's already a trained model with exceptionally high accuracy, high performance. Yeah, even though it's trained with different data sets, but it really helps to improve our model performance, model accuracy, model loss. For example, like MobileNet, VGC19, VGC16, EfficientNet, it will help to improve our models, comparing to the one if you use a traditional CNN model. So, yeah, CNN model with the convolutional 2D, yeah, max pooling, and yeah, it's quite good, actually, to use transfer learning. It really helps with our model performance, to improve our model performance.\",\n          \" Describe the process of building a new section, okay. The CNN one, right? So, at the first time, of course, we need to make sure the image folder is split for each class, okay? And then we can use Keras preprocessing, if I'm not mistaken, image dataset from directory to split the training and the validation dataset, right? Yeah, of course, we can use another set, which is the test dataset, yeah. But, yeah, okay, the next one, we can just, maybe we need to implement also the image augmentation, yeah, data image augmentation to make our dataset more veritative, right? For example, like, we can rotate, we can zoom it, we can crop it, yeah. And, yeah, the last thing, yeah, of course, we can build our chain model with the Convolutional 2D, specify the filters, the kernel size, the LRM definition, of course, the input shape for the first layer, and then we can apply the Max Pooling 2D, yeah, and the next layer, we can just use Convolutional 2D, Max Pooling, and whatever it is. And after that, we apply the flatten layer and dropout layer, if you want. And the last thing, don't forget to use the dash layer, right, for the output, the last output layer.\",\n          \" Describe a core model you've built and the steps you took to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Complex transfer model you've built to ensure accuracy. Okay, I will take one of my previous projects that I used. I also used Keras transfer model. It is about celiac disease prediction. This is also I used the research project for my undergraduate thesis, for my scripts. I used this model. It's quite challenging. Even though it's achieved high accuracy with some dense layer, with some drawout layer. And trial and error also with the callback function with the neurons.

Yeah, even though it's trained with different data sets, but it really helps to improve our model performance, model accuracy, model loss. For example, like MobileNet, VGC19, VGC16, EfficientNet, it will help to improve our models, comparing to the one if you use a traditional CNN model.
